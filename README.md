# Advent of Code Solutions

These are my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions, starting from 2022. They are written in Rust, Java, and Python, with no particular pattern to which language I use for which problem.

The code is optimized for nothing. I'm just trying to get the right answer as fast as possible, and learn a little bit about the languages I'm using.

## Usage

Solutions are in `/done` and are organized by problem number. Part 1 and part 2 of each problem are in different files, denoted by `.1` and `.2` respectively. They have different file extensions based on the languages they're written in. For example, the solution to problem 4 part 2, written in rust, is `/done/4.2.rs`.

Edited solutions are in `/done/edited`. These are solutions that I've edited after the fact as a challenge (fit all code on one line, etc). The different versions of the solutions are in different files, denoted by `.1`, `.2`, etc. For example, first edited version of problem 4 part 1, written in rust, is in `/done/edited/4.1.1.rs`.

### Rust (.rs)

1. Download [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Copy the code of the file you want to run into `/rust/src/main.rs`
3. Run `cargo run`. For slower code, it might help to run `cargo run --release`.

### Java (.java)

1. Download [Java](https://www.java.com/)
2. Copy the code of the file you want to run into `/java/Main.java`
3. Run `javac Main.java; java Main`

### Python (.py)

1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Copy the code of the file you want to run into `/python/main.py`
3. Run `python3 main.py`

## Working folders

The folders `/rust`, `/java`, and `/python` are for working on the solutions, and do not contain the final solutions. The final solutions are in `/done`.
